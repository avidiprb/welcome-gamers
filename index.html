                    <p> Fortnite is a free-to-play battle-royale where 100 players on a massive island try to outshoot 
                        and outbuild each other (forts are built for protection and high-ground to get a better view to 
                        shoot opponents better).</p>

                <h2>2 OF 5: WHY FORTNITE?</h2>
                    <p>Fortnite is the best deal in video games. This skill-based game combines the majority of skills and 
                        genres found in video games: platforming, shooting, building, gathering, driving, puzzle solving, 
                        and avatar customizing. You can choose and customize your avatar depending on which character and 
                        accessories you buy from the game.</p>

                    of the island map. There are 17 named locations. There are different biomes 
                    in this map, a forest biome, a desert biome, a snowy biome, a grassy biome, 
                    and a tropical biome.">

                    </table>
                    <p>In the 100 player battle royale match, after you dive from the flying bus, you use your glider to land 
                        at a place in the island where there are many chests and buildings which are surrounded by nature to 
                        gather weapons, heals, and materials for builds. </p>
                    <img src="assets/images/fortniteBRMeLanding.png" alt="In my screenshot is a view of 
                    me controlling my avatar to land in a town which is a little futuristic.">
                    <table id="caption1">
                        <caption>I decided to land in this town which is a little futuristic.</caption>
                    </table>
                    <p>There is a safe circular zone which appears on the map later in the game. Go to the safe zone which changes 
                        location at later points in the game. The safe zone also gets smaller each time it changes location. If you 
                        are out of the safe zone long enough, your health will go down to zero and you are out of the game. As you 
                        get to the safe zone or are already inside the safe zone, you can build-fight other players. To clarify, when 
                        you build-fight another player, you build walls, floors, ramps, and roofs one right after the other, and 
                        make windows, entrances, and passageways one right after the other all through multiple, fast button 
                        presses. Doing all this, you block and attack the player when there is an opening available like 
                        it’s a martial arts fight. One best practice, before or in between fighting players, is to gather better 
                        weapons, heals, and materials. The last player standing gets a #1 Victory Royale!</p>

                <h2>4 OF 5: WHAT DEVICES DO I NEED TO PLAY IT?</h2>
                    <p>All you need is a 1080p TV and a games system called an Xbox Series X or Xbox One X which is cheaper but the 
                        difference in performance between the systems is too small to notice. Xbox gives the most flexibility in 
                        playing games. You can buy a game from the Xbox’s large selection of games but still play it on a newer 
                        Xbox system unlike other games system brands.</p>
                <h2>5 OF 5: WHAT ABOUT A GAMING COMPUTER?</h2>
                    <p>You will have an amazing experience playing Fortnite on a games system but if you want to become a pro-level 
                        player, then that is where you use a gaming computer. If you are a child, it is best to hold off on playing 
                        on a gaming computer as it costs much more money than a games system, however if a parent has a gaming 
                        computer to do work on, then play on that when the parent is not working until you are able to pay for a gaming 
                        computer yourself. The best practice for a player to pay for their own gaming computer is to do it when they 
                        have a full-time job.</p>
